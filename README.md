# Credit Risk Probability Model for Alternative Data
**Bati Bank – Buy-Now-Pay-Later Credit Scoring Project**  
*December 2025*

An end-to-end machine learning project to build, deploy, and automate a credit risk model using alternative transactional data from an eCommerce partner. The model estimates default probability for BNPL customers using RFM-derived features and behavioral signals.

---
## Business Goal
Bati Bank is launching a Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) service in partnership with a leading eCommerce platform. To approve loans responsibly while expanding financial inclusion, we need a credit scoring model that:

- **Predicts the probability of default** using only alternative data (no traditional credit bureau scores).
- **Transforms customer behavioral patterns** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) into predictive risk signals.
- **Outputs an interpretable credit score** and recommends optimal loan amount/duration.
- **Meets regulatory expectations** for risk measurement, interpretability, and documentation.
## Project Overview
We engineer a **proxy target variable** for credit risk (high-risk vs. low-risk customers) based on disengagement patterns, then train supervised models to predict this risk. The final product is a production-ready FastAPI service that serves real-time risk probabilities.

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Comprehensive EDA with actionable insights
- [ ] Automated feature engineering pipeline (RFM + WoE/IV)
- [ ] Proxy target creation via RFM + K-Means clustering
- [ ] Multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost/LightGBM) with MLflow tracking
- [ ] Best model registered and deployed via FastAPI + Docker
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with linting and unit tests
- [ ] Full documentation and reproducible environment

## Credit Scoring Business Understanding
*(Task 1 Analysis)*

### 1. Basel II Implications
**Basel II Capital Accord** emphasizes robust, risk-sensitive measurement of credit risk, requiring banks to hold capital proportional to the actual risk of their portfolios (Pillar 1). This drives the need for **interpretable and well-documented models** that allow regulators to verify risk calculations and ensure fair treatment of borrowers.

### 2. The Need for Proxy Variables
Since the dataset lacks a direct "default" label, we create a **proxy variable based on RFM behavioral patterns** (low engagement → high risk of future default). 
*   **Business Risk:** Using a proxy introduces the risk of misclassifying truly good customers or under-estimating risk in edge cases. This could potentially lead to higher defaults (financial loss) or lost revenue from overly conservative approvals (opportunity cost).

### 3. Model Trade-offs
In a regulated environment, we must balance:
*   **Simple & Interpretable (e.g., Logistic Regression with WoE):** Preferred for easier regulatory approval, explainability, and auditability.
*   **Complex High-Performance (e.g., Gradient Boosting):** Offers better predictive accuracy but is harder to explain ("black box") and validate.

*Strategy: We prioritize interpretability while using ensemble methods where performance gains are significant, ensuring all model decisions are thoroughly documented.*

## Top 5 Key Insights from EDA (Task 2 Deliverable)

1. **Severe Class Imbalance in Target**  
   Only 193 fraud cases out of 95,662 transactions → **0.20% fraud rate**. This confirms the need for a proxy target (RFM-based disengagement) instead of using FraudResult directly.

2. **Amount vs Value Relationship & Hidden Fees**  
   - 39.9% of transactions have negative Amount (refunds/cash-ins)  
   - In 2.68% of cases, `Value > |Amount|` → this difference is a **transaction fee/commission** (0.55–5,400 UGX)  
   → **Strong behavioral signal**: customers paying higher fees may be higher-risk or higher-value

3. **Extreme Right-Skew in Transaction Amounts**  
   Most transactions are small (< 10,000 UGX), but a long tail exists up to 98.8 million UGX. Log transformation clearly needed for modeling.

4. **Dominant Categories & Channels**  
   - Top 2 ProductCategories (financial_services + airtime) = 94% of volume  
   - ChannelId_3 (likely USSD) dominates with 59%, ChannelId_2 (web/app) with 39%  
   → Clear customer segments emerging

5. **Single Country & Currency**  
   All transactions are in Uganda (CountryCode 256, Currency UGX) → we can safely drop these columns.

**Bonus Insight**: Average customer has ~25 transactions over ~19 active days — perfect for RFM segmentation.

## Proxy Target Creation (Task 4 Summary)

Since the dataset contains no direct "default" or "credit risk" label, we engineered a **behavioral proxy target** called `is_high_risk` to enable supervised learning.

### Approach
- Calculated **RFM metrics** for each customer:
  - **Recency**: Days since last transaction (snapshot date = last transaction date + 1 day)
  - **Frequency**: Total number of transactions
  - **Monetary**: Total absolute transaction amount (`total_amount`)
- Applied **log transformation** (`log1p`) to handle extreme skew in Frequency and Monetary
- **Standardized** the transformed RFM features
- Performed **K-Means clustering** (k=3, `random_state=42`) on scaled RFM data
- Analyzed cluster profiles and identified the **high-risk cluster** as the one with the **lowest Monetary value** (strongly correlated with low Frequency and high Recency — classic disengagement pattern)
- Assigned `is_high_risk = 1` to customers in the high-risk cluster, `0` otherwise

### Result
- High-risk customers represent approximately **XX%** of the population (exact % shown when script is run)
- Final dataset saved as `data/processed/customer_features_with_target.csv` (or .parquet), ready for model training

This proxy enables us to train predictive models that estimate default probability based on behavioral disengagement — a standard and effective approach in alternative credit scoring when true default labels are unavailable.
